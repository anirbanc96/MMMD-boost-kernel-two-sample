Parameter Settings for the Conducted Tests

All parameters same as the local power experiment conducted previously for comparing multiple and single kernel tests. 

1. For MMDAgg Tests:

500 iterations were performed for estimating power. Wild Bootstrap was performed.

1a. Gaussian <- Weight : Increasing
		Lambda Range : (-2,2)
1b. Laplace <- Weight: Increasing
	       Lambda Range : (-2,2)

2. For MMMD Tests:

2a. Gaussian <- Median Bandwidth range : (-2, 2)

2b. Laplace <- Median Bandwidth range : (-2, 2)

2c. Mixed <- Median Bandwidth range : (-1, 1) for both Gaussian and Laplace.
