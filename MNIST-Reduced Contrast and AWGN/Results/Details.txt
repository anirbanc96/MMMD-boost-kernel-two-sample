In this experiment I compared between the detecting power of the methods with increasingly added noise didgits.
The data was scaled to [0,1] before starting the experiment. 
The sets considered were:

1. c(2,4,8,9) vs c(3,4,7,9)
2. c(1,2,4,8,9) vs c(1,3,4,7,9)
3. c(0,1,2,4,8,9) vs c(0,1,3,4,7,9)
4. c(0,1,2,4,5,8,9) vs c(0,1,3,4,5,7,9)
5. c(0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9) vs c(0,1,3,4,5,6,7,9)

Number of Repetitions done: 30
Number of resamples drawn: 150
