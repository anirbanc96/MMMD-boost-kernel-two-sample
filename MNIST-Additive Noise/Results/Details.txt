In this experiment I compared between the detecting power of the methods with increasingly added gaussian noise.
The data was scaled to [0,1] before starting the experiment. 
The set considered was c(1,2,3) vs c(1,2,8)

Errors were added with increasing variance of gaussians - (0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1)

Number of Repetitions done: 50
Number of resamples drawn: 100
