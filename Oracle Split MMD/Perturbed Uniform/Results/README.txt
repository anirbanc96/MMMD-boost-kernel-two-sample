Parameter Settings for the Conducted Tests

1. For MMDAgg Tests:

All iterate values and sample sizes were taken as in MMDAgg paper. Wild Bootstrap was performed.

1a. Gaussian <- Weight : Increasing
		Lambda Range : (-6, -2)
1b. Laplace <- Weight: Increasing
	       Lambda Range : (-6, -2)

2. For MMMD Tests:

2a. Gaussian <- Median Bandwidth range : (-2, 2)

2b. Laplace <- Median Bandwidth range : (-2, 2)

2c. Mixed <- Median Bandwidth range : (-1, 1) for both Gaussian and Laplace.
